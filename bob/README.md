I never got this one to work. I had problems trying to parse the input. I tried to piece together different things I found in the textbook and sample functions I found online that used match statements. But then I thought it would just be easier to use if-else if - else structure instead, but ran out of time to implement it further.

ALL TESTS FAILED
