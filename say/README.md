I could not get this one to work properly with the test cases. The function and logic work fine when used in the rust-playground, but would not pass any tests when imported and used with the test file. I stand by the code, but cant figure out why it wont work with the tests.

ALL TESTS FAILED  ------ Worked in rust-playground
